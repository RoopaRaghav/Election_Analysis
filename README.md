# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview 
The purpose of this project was to provide an election audit for the Colorado Board of Elections. 

1. Calculate the total number of votes casted.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Get the county who had the highest voter turnout. 
4. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received. 
5. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won. 
6. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

# Challenge Summary
 Firstly, the code can be modified considering the things like ballots are electronic or paper and based on that the candidates appeals will get affected.
 Secondly, the code can be modified with any new additions considering the ethnicity of the candidates , considering the parties like congress or independent
 candidates or considering the cities like wise.
 To add these modifications the elections_data.csv needs to be updated with additional data.
 Those are some of the challenges that can incorporated and PyPoll.py can be refactored to perform the analysis and get the results.
 The output file is just a text file not so pleasing can be modified to visualise the data better.
